MASTER-SLAVE REPLICATION IN MARIADB




Master:


Changes in my.cnf configuration:


Add the following parameters:


log-bin
server_id           = 1
binlog-format   = MIXED
binlog-do-db = replicate


Open the MariaDB shell and do the following MariaDB master replication configuration:


MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'slave3'@'192.168.0.232' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';        
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO slave3 IDENTIFIED BY '123456' WITH GRANT OPTION;
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW MASTER STATUS;
MariaDB [(none)]> UNLOCK TABLES; 


Slave:


Connect to the local MariaDB server :


MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON replicate.* To 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456'  WITH GRANT OPTION;
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;




Changes in my.cnf configuration:


Add the following parameters:


log-bin
server_id           = 2
replicate-do-db = replicate
binlog_format   = MIXED
Log on to the database and run the following commands in the MariaDB prompt


MariaDB [(none)]> STOP SLAVE;
MariaDB [(none)]> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='192.168.0.232',MASTER_USER='slave3', MASTER_PASSWORD='123456',MASTER_PORT=3307,MASTER_LOG_FILE='master-bin.000007',MASTER_LOG_POS=1806;


MariaDB [(none)]> START SLAVE;
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;
                               SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS\G;




create and add a record to the replicate database in the master server.
Then verify that this change was replicated in the slave.
